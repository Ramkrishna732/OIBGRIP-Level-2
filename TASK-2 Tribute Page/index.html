                Milkha Singh was an Indian track and field sprinter who was the first Indian male athlete to win an individual athletics gold medal at a Commonwealth Games. Fondly called ‘The Flying Sikh’—a title bequeathed to him by the former President of Pakistan, General Ayub Khan—he is highly respected for his sporting achievements. He has made his motherland proud by winning several Gold medals in international sporting events like the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games. He had entered the 400m race at the 1960 Olympic Games as one of the favorites and had even led the race till the 200m mark before he lost his speed and other runners overtook him. Sadly, the contender for Gold couldn’t even win a Bronze! Yet even in losing he set an Indian national record for 400m. Milkha Singh’s story is one of hope and inspiration. As a teenager he witnessed the massacre of his whole family in front of his eyes. Orphaned and heart-broken he worked up his way through life, seeking solace in the running. After years of struggle he became a successful man and later on supported needy sportsmen through the Milkha Singh Charitable trust.

                In 1974, Jobs travelled with Daniel Kottke to India in search of spiritual enlightenment. They travelled to the Ashram of Neem Karoli Baba in Kainchi. During his several months in India, he became aware of Buddhist and Eastern spiritual philosophy. At this time, he also experimented with psychedelic drugs; he later commented that these counter-culture experiences were instrumental in giving him a wider perspective on life and business.
                <br>
                Milkha Singh was born into a Sikh Rathore Rajput family in Punjab, in undivided India during the pre-independence days. He was one of 15 siblings, many of whom died during childhood.

                The partition of Indian happened when he was still a teenager. In the violence that ensued, he witnessed the killings of his parents and several siblings before his very eyes. His father, as he lay dying told Milkha to run for his life.
                
                Hindus and Sikhs were targeted and mercilessly killed in Punjab. Milkha Singh escaped to Delhi in 1947. Thankfully he had a married sister living there who helped him in his rehabilitation.
                
                He was very heart broken and disillusioned after losing so many members of his family and he considered becoming a dacoit. However, one of his brothers advised him to join the army instead.
